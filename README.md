# AdventOfCode2021
My solutions to the Advent of Code 2021 puzzles

The solution files will be cleaned up a little (removed comments & excess prints, fixed formatting, improve variable names)
 but the logic will remain the same as they was when each answer was submitted. 
 
 Coding in Python again this year. I am using a cmd Curl command to download my input files.
